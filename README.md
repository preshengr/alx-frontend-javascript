## Installation

To get started with the `alx-frontend-javascript` repository, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alx-frontend-javascript.git
cd alx-frontend-javascript
npm install
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the JavaScript files directly using Node.js. Each file demonstrates a specific concept or feature of JavaScript. To execute a file, use the following command format:

```bash
node <filename>
```

For example, to run the `0-constants.js` file, you would use:

```bash
node 0-constants.js
```

You can explore the different files to understand various JavaScript concepts, such as:

- **Constants**: Learn how to declare constants using `const`.
- **Arrow Functions**: Understand the syntax and use of arrow functions.
- **Object Manipulation**: Get familiar with creating and iterating through objects.

Feel free to modify the JavaScript code in each file to experiment with the concepts presented.

## File Descriptions

Here’s a detailed description of each file in the repository:

- **.eslintrc.cjs**: Configuration file for ESLint, which helps maintain code quality by enforcing coding conventions and catching errors in your JavaScript code.

- **0-constants.js**: Demonstrates the usage of `const` for declaring constant variables in JavaScript.

- **1-block-scoped.js**: Illustrates the concept of block scoping with `let` and `const`, showcasing how variables are scoped within blocks.

- **10-loops.js**: Provides examples of various looping constructs in JavaScript, including `for`, `while`, and `for...of`.

- **100-createIteratorObject.js**: Implements an iterator for an object, allowing iteration over its properties in a custom manner.

- **101-iterateThroughObject.js**: Shows how to iterate through an object’s properties and values, demonstrating different techniques for accessing object data.

- **11-createEmployeesObject.js**: Constructs an object to manage employee data, highlighting object creation and property access.

- **12-createReportObject.js**: Creates a report object that aggregates various data points, showcasing object manipulation and property assignment.

- **2-arrow.js**: Introduces arrow functions, demonstrating their syntax and how they differ from traditional function expressions.

- **3-default-parameter.js**: Explains how to set default parameters in functions, allowing for more flexible function calls.

- **4-rest-parameter.js**: Demonstrates the rest parameter syntax, which allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

- **5-spread-operator.js**: Showcases the spread operator, which expands an array or object into individual elements or properties.

- **6-string-interpolation.js**: Illustrates string interpolation using template literals, making it easier to construct strings with embedded expressions.

- **7-getBudgetObject.js**: Contains a function that retrieves a budget object, demonstrating how to manage and access nested objects.

- **8-getBudgetCurrentYear.js**: Fetches budget data specific to the current year, highlighting the use of date objects and conditional logic.

- **9-getFullBudget.js**: Aggregates and returns the full budget, combining data from various sources into a single output.

- **package.json**: The manifest file for the project that includes metadata, dependencies, and scripts necessary for the project.

- **package-lock.json**: Automatically generated file that locks the installed versions of dependencies, ensuring consistent installations across environments.

## Linting

To maintain code quality, this project uses ESLint. You can run the linter with the following command:

```bash
npx eslint .
```

This command will check all JavaScript files in the repository for style issues and potential errors based on the configuration specified in `.eslintrc.cjs`.
