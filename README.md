## Usage

Once installed, you can run the JavaScript and TypeScript files using Node.js. Navigate to the desired directory and use the following command:

```bash
node <filename>
```

For example, to run a file in the `0x00-ES6_basic` directory:

```bash
node 0x00-ES6_basic/<filename>
```

Feel free to explore each subdirectory to familiarize yourself with the various concepts.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following subdirectories:

- **0x00-ES6_basic**: Contains basic ES6 features and syntax, such as let/const, arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring.
  
- **0x01-ES6_promise**: Focuses on JavaScript promises, their syntax, and how to handle asynchronous operations effectively.
  
- **0x02-ES6_classes**: Explores ES6 class syntax, including inheritance, static methods, and property initializers.
  
- **0x03-ES6_data_manipulation**: Provides examples and techniques for manipulating data structures like arrays and objects using ES6 features.
  
- **0x04-TypeScript**: Introduces TypeScript, its benefits, and how to use it in conjunction with JavaScript for type safety and enhanced development.

## File Descriptions

Hereâ€™s a detailed description of each file in the root of the repository:

- **.eslintrc.js**: Configuration file for ESLint, which enforces coding standards and detects potential issues in JavaScript code.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git, preventing unnecessary files from being tracked.

- **babel.config.js**: Configuration file for Babel, which allows you to use the latest JavaScript features while ensuring compatibility with older environments.

- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and project information.

- **package-lock.json**: Automatically generated file that locks the versions of dependencies installed, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Linting

To maintain code quality, this project uses ESLint. You can run the linter with the following command:

```bash
npx eslint .
```

This command will check all JavaScript files in the repository for style issues and potential errors based on the configuration specified in `.eslintrc.js`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request. Ensure that your code adheres to the linting rules defined in the ESLint configuration.
